<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Constant Velocity Joints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ball Type</li><li>Fork Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Constant velocity joints (CV joints) are essential components in vehicle axle systems, ensuring smooth power transmission and allowing for changes in angle and rotational speed. In the market, there are two common types: ball type and fork type. Ball type CV joints have spherical grooves that house ball bearings, allowing continuous variable angle transmission. On the other hand, fork type CV joints use a cylindrical shaft and twin forked arms to transmit torque at constant velocity. Both types serve distinct purposes, offering options to manufacturers depending on the vehicle's requirements and design.</p></p>
