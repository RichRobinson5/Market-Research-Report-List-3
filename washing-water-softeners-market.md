<p><ul><li>Salt Based Water Softener</li><li>Salt Free Water Softener</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Salt-based water softeners use salt to remove minerals such as calcium and magnesium, which cause hard water. These systems regenerate by flushing the minerals out with salt water. Salt-free water softeners, on the other hand, use alternative methods such as filtration or magnetic fields to treat hard water without the need for salt. Both types of water softeners are designed to improve water quality, prevent scale buildup, and extend the lifespan of appliances that use water.</p></p>
