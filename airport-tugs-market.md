<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airport Tugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Towbars</li><li>Towbarless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Airport tugs refer to vehicles used to move aircraft on the ground. There are two main types of tugs in the market - conventional towbars and towbarless. Conventional towbars are used to connect the tug to the nose landing gear of the aircraft, allowing for towing. On the other hand, towbarless tugs eliminate the need for a towbar by lifting the aircraft's nose landing gear directly, making them more efficient and faster. These market types cater to the different needs and preferences of the aviation industry when it comes to ground handling operations.</p></p>
