<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Motor Starters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reduced Voltage AC Starters</li><li>Full Voltage AC Motor Starters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC motor starters are devices used to control the starting and stopping of AC motors. Reduced voltage AC starters, as the name suggests, gradually apply voltage to the motor, reducing the initial current surge during start-up and minimizing stress on the motor. This type of starter is commonly used for larger motors. Full voltage AC motor starters, on the other hand, apply full power to the motor from the start. They are typically used for smaller motors where the initial surge of current is not a concern.</p></p>
