<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Scrubbing Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Jet & Venturi Scrubbers</li><li>Orifice Scrubbers</li><li>Packed Bed Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas scrubbing systems are used to remove pollutants and contaminants from industrial exhaust gases. Jet and venturi scrubbers use high-velocity jets of liquid to create a scrubbing action, effectively capturing impurities. Orifice scrubbers use a narrow opening to generate turbulent flow and enhance gas-liquid mixing, while packed bed scrubbers contain a packed bed of media (such as plastic balls or metal rings) to increase contact between the gas and liquid phases for better removal efficiency. These different scrubbers offer varying advantages and are used across industries to meet emission standards.</p></p>
