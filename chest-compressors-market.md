<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chest Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Electric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chest compressors market consists of two main types - mechanical and electric. Mechanical chest compressors are devices that physically compress the chest of a patient to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). They are often operated by hand and provide consistent and controlled chest compressions. On the other hand, electric chest compressors are automated devices that use electrical power to deliver CPR. They are designed to provide consistent and effective compressions at a higher rate than manual compressions. Both types of chest compressors aim to assist in maintaining blood circulation during CPR.</p></p>
