<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB Photosensitive Solder Resist Ink Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Photosensitive</li><li>Uv Cured</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PCB Photosensitive Solder Resist Ink comes in two main types: Liquid Photosensitive and UV Cured. Liquid Photosensitive solder resist ink requires exposure to UV light to harden and create a protective layer on the PCB. On the other hand, UV Cured solder resist ink is already pre-cured and only requires exposure to UV light for a short period of time to ensure adhesion to the PCB surface. Both types of solder resist ink offer effective protection against solder bridging and other potential issues in PCB assembly.</p></p>
