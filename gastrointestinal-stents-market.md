<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gastrointestinal Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-expanding Metal Stents</li><li>Plastic Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gastrointestinal stents are medical devices used for the treatment of various gastrointestinal conditions, such as tumors, strictures, and blockages. They are available in two main types: self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) and plastic stents. SEMS are made of metal and have the ability to expand when deployed in the targeted area, providing a wider passage for the flow of bodily substances. On the other hand, plastic stents are made of synthetic materials and are typically used in cases where temporary relief is required or in patients with contraindications for metal stents. Both types of stents serve to restore proper function and alleviate symptoms associated with gastrointestinal disorders.</p></p>
