<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Three Phase Electricity Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IC Card</li><li>Non-IC Card</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial three-phase electricity smart meter market can be divided into two main types: IC card and non-IC card markets. In the IC card market, smart meters use Integrated Circuit (IC) technology to store and manage energy consumption data. These meters require users to insert a special card to access their electricity usage information. On the other hand, the non-IC card market utilizes alternative methods, such as wireless communication or digital displays, to provide real-time energy data without the need for physical cards. Both types serve the purpose of accurately monitoring and managing commercial electricity consumption.</p></p>
