<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Microgrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied</li><li>Independent</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>A grid-tied solar microgrid is connected to the main power grid, allowing the flow of electricity back and forth between the microgrid and the grid. This type is useful in areas where there is an intermittent power supply as excess electricity generated by the solar microgrid can be shared with the main grid. On the other hand, an independent solar microgrid operates autonomously, completely disconnected from the main grid. This is preferable in remote areas where grid access is limited, providing a reliable and sustainable source of electricity.</p></p>
