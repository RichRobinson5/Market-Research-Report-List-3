<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Grinding Tapes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UV Type</li><li>Non-UV Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wafer grinding tapes are used in the semiconductor industry to temporarily attach wafers to a carrier during the grinding process. There are two main types of wafer grinding tapes: UV type and Non-UV type. UV type tapes have UV curable adhesive that allows for easy removal after grinding, while Non-UV type tapes use a heat-curable adhesive. Both types offer good adhesion and residue-free removal, but UV type tapes are preferred for their faster removal process and lower risk of wafer breakage.</p></p>
