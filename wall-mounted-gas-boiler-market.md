<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wall Mounted Gas Boiler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wall-mounted gas boilers are heating systems that are installed on walls and used for heating residential and commercial spaces. They are available in two types: condensing and non-condensing boilers. Condensing boilers are more energy-efficient as they recover heat from the flue gases and use it to pre-heat the water, resulting in lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions. Non-condensing boilers, on the other hand, do not recover heat from the flue gases and are less energy-efficient.</p></p>
