<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Rubber Fenders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Chain Type</li><li>Without Chain Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Pneumatic Rubber Fenders market includes two main types, namely Chain Type and Without Chain Type. The Chain Type fenders are equipped with chains that run through the body of the fender, providing additional strength and stability. These fenders are commonly used in places with strong tidal waves or higher marine traffic, as they offer better resistance. On the other hand, Without Chain Type fenders are free from chains and are typically utilized in relatively calmer environments. Both types of fenders are designed to absorb impacts, protecting vessels and docks from damage.</p></p>
