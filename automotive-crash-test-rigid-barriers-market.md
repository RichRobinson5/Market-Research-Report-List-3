<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Crash Test Rigid Barriers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Frontal Impact Barrier</li><li>Side Impact Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive crash test rigid barriers market consists of two main types: frontal impact barriers and side impact barriers. Frontal impact barriers are used to simulate crashes that happen head-on, measuring the vehicle's ability to protect occupants. These barriers are designed to absorb energy and mimic the forces experienced during a frontal collision. On the other hand, side impact barriers are used to simulate crashes from the side, evaluating a vehicle's ability to protect occupants from lateral collisions. These barriers replicate the impact forces experienced during side collisions. Both types of barriers help assess vehicle safety levels and assist in improving crashworthiness.</p></p>
